      	<h1 class="green">The Lights Went Off</h1>
      <p>I was just about to go to sleep when NEPA finally brought the much needed light we had all been praying for...

Then just 5minutes later, the lights went off, NEPA had done it again - while I was still hoping to charge my phone.

There I was with a phone battery of 1%, no sensible, long-lasting power bank in sight and a pot of anger boiling hot within me.
</p>     	

<h1 class="green">Have You Ever Been In <br/>Such A Situation As I?</h1>
<p>Maybe you were about to send your payment details and then the lights went off...

Or maybe you were hosting a class on Telegram while charging your phone and then the lights went off...

Perhaps it was even worse - You were in a Zoom meeting with a famous entrepreneur and he was about to begin sharing the inner circle secrets of his business success and then the lights went off.

Ugh! Such great opportunity almost lost because of NEPA's epileptic electricity. 
So what do you do?
</p>

<h1 class="green">For such emergency <br/>situations as that, <br/>you need the:</h1>

	<h1 class="green">In Total, This Can Help You Save N28,800 On <br/>An Average Every Year!</h1>
	<p>The most common price you'll have to pay for charging a phone in shops that offer that service in Nigeria, is N100.

So if you charge one phone once every day, in a year you would have spent N36,500.

Wow! Imagine N36,500 being spent on charging a phone.

You could use that same amount to buy a working smartphone in Nigeria.

But if you get this power bank and charge it just once a week, you will be able to use for 168hours.

That helps you save 6-7 extra days of charging.

</p>
    
<h1 class="green">So How Does This Help Me<br/> Save N28,800 Yearly?</h1>
<p>Since the power bank helps you save   6-7 extra days of charging, then that is = 6 * N100, which equals to N600.

So you can save N600 every week.

<b>Now how about in a month? How much does this power bank helps you save in a month?</b>

There are 4weeks in a month so N600 * 4, which equals to N2,400 per month.

In a year, you'd be able to save:
N2,400 * 12 = N28,800 every year.
    	</p>
    
    
    <h1 class="green">So Which Is Better?</h1>
    <p>That you spend N36,500 a year just charging your phone... 

Or

You get the Oraimo power bank and save N28,800 every year.
    	</p>
    	
<h1 class="green">Do You Realize <br/>How Cheap This Is?</h1>

<p><b>For a 20,000 mAh, you'll have to spend only N15,500....

For a 27,000 mAh, you'll have to spend only N20,500....

For a 40,000 mAh, you'll have to spend only N27,000....
</b>
Just from plain reading it looks expensive, but that depends on if you're thinking about the cost or the price.
</p>

<h1 class="green">Is There A Difference?</h1>
<p><b>The price is what you have to pay immediately in order to purchase something.

The cost is what you have to pay over the years for choosing to buy that something.
</b>
Then you'll find out if it's worth it or not.

For example, let's say you get a power bank at a local market and you find out that it is sold for N3,000.

In your mind you're thinking 
"In places like Shoprite they would sell this kind of thing for N7,000 or more but here I am getting it for just N3,000."                                         

"I would be saving myself N4,000 or more if I buy it here."

"Besides is it not the same thing that is inside the power bank they are selling?" 

With that you convince yourself to buy it and you're happy with your choice until....

You get home and find out that the power bank can't even charge your phone battery to 100% nor can you boast of it lasting for up to 10hours.

<h1 class="green">You Think This Is <br/>Just A Story?</h1>

<p>It has happened to one of my family members and probably to many more that we don't know about.

It's been 1 and a half years since he bought it, and till now he still regrets that he made that choice.

<b>How sure are you that the local power bank that is cheap will still be worth what it was the first time you bought it in 2 years time?</b>

Today, if he would sell that power bank, someone may bargain its price down to N1,500 simply because now it's condition is much more worse.

So that will be a loss of N1,500.

But unlike the cheap local power bank, the Oraimo power bank has a long lasting battery that won't wear out so easily.

So if after a year you have bought it, you decide to sell it out, it will still be worth what it was when you bought it unless an event happened that got it spoilt.

<b>In 4 years, this power bank would have paid for itself 3-5 times.</b>

So if you look at the cost of not having the Oraimo power bank, it's N36,500 and some losses from buying bad power banks..

But the profit of having the Oraimo power bank is you get your money back four times or more in 4 years by saving 6-7 extra days of charging.

When you get the Oraimo power bank:

<span class="big">.</span>You won't have to worry about NEPA's decision to put off the electricity whenever they please.

<span class="big">.</span>You won't have to be spending N100 out of your purse daily just to keep your phone charged.

But instead, you'll be getting:

<span class="big">.</span>A battery you charge once that last for 168hours more

<span class="big">.</span>No after-regrets of choosing to buy the Oraimo power bank cause you'll find that, 
it saves you N28,800 on an average every year and it lasts long enough to charge your phone and other devices for 7days after it was charged.
